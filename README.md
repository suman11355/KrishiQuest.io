## 🧐 Problem Statementt

Farmers in India face immense financial risks due to unpredictable weather, volatile markets, and degrading soil health. They often have to make critical decisions about crops and fertilizers at the start of the season without knowing the likely outcome, essentially gambling with their livelihood. Furthermore, the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices is slow due to a lack of engaging, accessible education.

## 💡 Our Solution: The "Digital Twin" Approach

**KrishiQuest** is an AI-powered, gamified platform that creates a "Digital Twin" of a farmer's actual land using real-world data (Soil Health Cards, local weather patterns, and market trends).

Before planting a single seed, farmers can use KrishiQuest to run **risk-free simulations**. They can test different strategies (e.g., *"What if I switch to organic fertilizer for wheat this season?"*) and receive instant, data-driven forecasts on potential **net profit, crop yield, and long-term soil health impact**.

We wrap this powerful simulation engine in a gamified interface to make complex agricultural science accessible, engaging, and rewarding for the next generation of farmers.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🚜 The Core Simulation Engine
* **Hyper-Personalized "Digital Twin":** Ingests real data to model specific farm conditions.
* **AI-Powered Forecasting:** Uses a Python ML microservice to predict outcomes based on user inputs and environmental variables.
* **Risk-Free Experimentation:** Test chemical vs. integrated vs. organic farming strategies without financial consequence.

### 🎮 Gamification & Engagement Layer
* **📅 Smart Fasal Calendar:** A dynamic, gamified calendar that tells the farmer exactly *what* to do and *when* (sowing, irrigation, fertilization) based on their winning simulation strategy.
* **Interactive Quizzes:** Fun, bite-sized modules integrated into the game to educate farmers on best agricultural practices.
* **Achievement Badges & Leaderboards:** Reward systems for adopting sustainable practices (e.g., earning the "Soil Savior Badge" for improving organic carbon levels).
