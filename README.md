# KrishiQuest.io 🚜🌱

> A data-driven farming simulation platform that helps farmers and agri-enthusiasts test and evaluate farming decisions **before** applying them in real life.

## 🧠 About

**KrishiQuest.io** (also shown as *AgroPlay* in project view) is a Digital Twin–based agricultural decision support system. By simulating different farm scenarios using real farm data (like soil nutrients, weather, water availability, and market prices), users can:

- Visualize a **digital replica of their farm**
- Simulate crop and resource strategies
- Predict **yield, profits, and risk levels**
- Estimate **long-term soil health impact**

This approach helps reduce financial risk and enhances farming sustainability.
